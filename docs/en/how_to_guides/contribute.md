## How to contribute to this handbook

The intention of this handbook is to be useful in research at KTH and we believe the best way of making it more useful is by inviting the users, that is researchers' and PhD students to contribute with content. An editor will review any proposed changes before they become part of the handbook. The editor will make the decision if the change is within scope and may change minor things like grammar errors etc. 
We really want to be as inclusive as possible and make it easy for all KTH staff and PhD students to contribute. So you can select one of several alternative ways of contributing, see below:

A) by sending us an e-mail to researchdata@kth.se with proposed changes. Notice that it may take some time before anyone have time to review and make the changes visible on the web

B) Commit your suggested contribution directly on Github

For the B) option there are multiple ways of doing this and if you are already used to work in collaborative project with git, fork the repository at https://github.com/KTH-Library/kth-digital-research-handbook and work with your favorite editor/IDE like you are used to.
